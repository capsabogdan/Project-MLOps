<h1>Exam template for 02476 Machine Learning Operations</h1>
<p>This is the report template for the exam. Please only remove the text formatted as with three dashes in front and behind
like:</p>
<p><code>--- question 1 fill here ---</code></p>
<p>where you instead should add your answers. Any other changes may have unwanted consequences when your report is auto
generated in the end of the course. For questions where you are asked to include images, start by adding the image to
the <code>figures</code> subfolder (please only use <code>.png</code>, <code>.jpg</code> or <code>.jpeg</code>) and then add the following code in your answer:</p>
<p><code>markdown
![my_image](figures/&lt;image&gt;.&lt;extension&gt;)</code></p>
<p>In addition to this markdown file, we also provide the <code>report.py</code> script that provides two utility functions:</p>
<p>Running:</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py html</code></p>
<p>will generate an <code>.html</code> page of your report. After deadline for answering this template, we will autoscrape
everything in this <code>reports</code> folder and then use this utility to generate an <code>.html</code> page that will be your serve
as your final handin.</p>
<p>Running</p>
<p><code>bash
python report.py check</code></p>
<p>will check your answers in this template against the constrains listed for each question e.g. is your answer too
short, too long, have you included an image when asked to.</p>
<p>For both functions to work it is important that you do not rename anything. The script have two dependencies that can
be installed with <code>pip install click markdown</code>.</p>

<h2>Group information</h2>
<h3>Question 1</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the group number you signed up on <learn.inside.dtu.dk></strong></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- 17 ---</p>
<h3>Question 2</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Enter the study number for each member in the group</strong></p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p><em>sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX, sXXXXXX</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- s212558, s210172, s184419, s213158, s213161 ---</p>
<h3>Question 3</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What framework did you choose to work with and did it help you complete the project?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used the third-party framework ... in our project. We used functionality ... and functionality ... from the</em>
<em>package to do ... and ... in our project</em>.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- We used the third-party framework Pytorch-Geometric, which is a deep learning framework for geometric data such as graphs. This framework was extremely beneficial for us as we were working with graphical data - movie predictions based on user ratings. We used Pytorch-Geometric to set up the graphs when we were making the datasets. Furthermore, from Pytorch-Geometric we used the SAGEConv class in the GNNEncoder part of our model. In our projet we also use the Pytorch framework, which made the handling of tensors convenient. We also used the torch.nn.Linear class for making the FC layers in our EdgeDecoder part of our model. ---</p>
<h2>Coding environment</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in learning more about you local development environment.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 4</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Explain how you managed dependencies in your project? Explain the process a new team member would have to go</strong>
<strong>through to get an exact copy of your environment.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We used ... for managing our dependencies. The list of dependencies was auto-generated using ... . To get a</em>
<em>complete copy of our development enviroment, one would have to run the following commands</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- We used the pipreqs package, as well as some manual additions, to manage our dependencies. We ran the pipreqs command in our project to generate a 'requirements.txt' file with the libraries, and the versions, required for our project. We experienced some problems with some of the libraries such as torch-geometric, so for those we would sometimes have to manually change the order and version of the install. We also have a 'requirements_docker_train.txt' file, which is used when making a docker image. To get a complete copy of our dependencies, one would have to make a new empty python environment, go to the project root, and run "pip install -r requirements.txt" ---</p>
<h3>Question 5</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>We expect that you initialized your project using the cookiecutter template. Explain the overall structure of your</strong>
<strong>code. Did you fill out every folder or only a subset?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words</p>
<p>Example:
<em>From the cookiecutter template we have filled out the ... , ... and ... folder. We have removed the ... folder</em>
<em>because we did not use any ... in our project. We have added an ... folder that contains ... for running our</em>
<em>experiments.</em>
Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- We used the cookiecutter template to initialize our project. In the src/models folder we have made a 'model.py' file which describes our model, a 'train_model.py' script for training the model, and a 'predict_model.py' script for predictng. In the '<em>init</em>.py' file we have included some paths. We have filled out the 'make_dataset.py' script in the src/data folder such that it takes the raw data and processes it, and then placed the processed data in the data/processed folder. The data processing includes some data enriching, which is done with the help of the 'oasis.py' script. We use both the raw and processed data folders, but we have removed the external and interim folders. ---</p>
<h3>Question 6</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you implement any rules for code quality and format? Additionally, explain with your own words why these</strong>
<strong>concepts matters in larger projects.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- We wrote our code following the pep8 protocol, to have a single style for our whole project and make it easier for all our members to read the other members' code. We also used isort for sorting our imports. For the 'make_dataset.py' script, we implemented code from this <a href="https://medium.com/arangodb/integrate-arangodb-with-pytorch-geometric-to-build-recommendation-systems-dd69db688465">this</a> blog post, thus we decided to just leave the code format as it was. Following a specific code format such as pep8 is important in large projects because this means that code written from different users will be in the same format and thus more understandable. ---</p>
<h2>Version control</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the following section we are interested in how version control was used in your project during development to
corporate and increase the quality of your code.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Question 7</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How many tests did you implement and what are they testing in your code?</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 50-100 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>In total we have implemented X tests. Primarily we are testing ... and ... as these the most critical parts of our</em>
<em>application but also ... .</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 7 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 8</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the total code coverage (in percentage) of your code? If you code had an code coverage of 100% (or close</strong>
<strong>to), would you still trust it to be error free? Explain you reasoning.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>The total code coverage of code is X%, which includes all our source code. We are far from 100% coverage of our </em><em>
</em>code and even if we were then...*</p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- question 8 fill here ---</p>
<h3>Question 9</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you workflow include using branches and pull requests? If yes, explain how. If not, explain how branches and</strong>
<strong>pull request can help improve version control.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We made use of both branches and PRs in our project. In our group, each member had an branch that they worked on in</em>
<em>addition to the main branch. To merge code we ...</em></p>
<p>Answer:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>--- In our GitHub repository we used three branches: master, test, and dev. In our master branch we have our producting-ready code, which is code that we know is running as it should (but at the start of the project it didn't have all the right functionality). When we were developing our model, data, training, etc. we would all push to the dev branch. When pushing to the dev branch no tests are performed, making the process faster. This is useful when we are just making small changes or fixes, e.g. spelling mistakes. We would then merge the dev branch to the test branch, where we would perform our tests. This process takes a bit of time, but since we don't do it as often this is not a problem. When we have code that we are satisfied with in our test branch, we would send a pull request to the master branch. ---</p>
<h3>Question 10</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Did you use DVC for managing data in your project? If yes, then how did it improve your project to have version</strong>
<strong>control of your data. If no, explain a case where it would be beneficial to have version control of your data.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 100-200 words.</p>
<p>Example:
<em>We did make use of DVC in the following way: ... . In the end it helped us in ... for controlling ... part of our</em>
<em>pipeline</em></p>

<p><strong>Discuss you continues integration setup. What kind of CI are you running (unittesting, linting, etc.)? Do you test</strong>
<strong>multiple operating systems, python version etc. Do you make use of caching? Feel free to insert a link to one of</strong>
<strong>your github actions workflow.</strong></p>
<p>Answer length: 200-300 words.</p>
