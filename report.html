<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This repository contains the project work carried out in the MLOps course taught at DTU, in a group of 5 consisting of: </p>
<p>Name  | Student number
------------- | -------------
Alexandra Polymenopoulou  | s212558
Bogdan Capsa  |   s210172
Jakob Fahl | s184419
Melina Siskou | s213158
Thomas Spyrou | s213161</p>
<h4>Goal</h4>
<p>The purpose of this project is to build a movie Recommendation System. In this project we will mainly focus on the pipeline of the system rather than the model itself.</p>
<h4>Framework</h4>
<p>We will be using Pytorch Geometric a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to structured data. Inference is performed using ONNX Runtime and fastai. Utilities are provided by Hydra. </p>
<h4>Data</h4>
<p>The Data is obtained using ArangoDB, containing 45463 records and 24 features. We are going to use the sampled version of The Movies Dataset. The dataset contains 3 csv files:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>movies_metadata.csv</strong>: Contains information on 45,000 movies featured in the Full MovieLens dataset. Features include posters, backdrops, budget, revenue, release dates, languages, production countries and companies.</li>
<li><strong>links_small.csv</strong>: Contains the TMDB and IMDB IDs of a small subset of 9,000 movies of the Full Dataset.</li>
<li><strong>ratings_small.csv</strong>: subset of 100,000 ratings from 700 users on 9,000 movies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Model</h4>
<p>This Graph Neural Network model (with CNNs) is designed to predict the movies that a user has not watched yet, based on the links between the user and other movies.</p>
